## New rules for Whot Card Game - Long Version

WHOT cards game and rules

Start with a random card of the game shape or number

if you have a more than one card of the same number you can play both

there are special cards

these are 2(make the other player pick 2)

5 (makes another player pick 3)

14 (general market, so everyone besides you has to pick one card)

next rule

other special cards are :

1 ( hold on) everyone playing has to wait for you to play another card (lets say you play a star you have to play the same shape

2 8 (suspension) suspending the player from a play but if it is more than 1r player it is the next person you suspend so the person after that can play

then the WHOT WHOT (that is 20) you can play it on any card ( tell them the shape you want ) basically for asking for any other card or to mimick a card you want to play but don't have

the picking action cards

you can block pick 8 besides general market

any card besides general market (14) pick 2 or pick 3 you can block

you can only do "playing more than one card that is the same" if it is the same number not shape

_Special cards_

1 - hold on

8 - suspension

20 (whot) - asking cards

_Picking/action cards_

14 (general market) - pick one

2 - pick 2

5 - pick 3

If someone plays a card with triangle and the number 2, to block you play any card with the number 2 on it. Same applies to any card with number 5 but you _can't block_ general market

For our digital version of the game, if they can't play in less than 3 minutes, the player will lose their chance and be handed a random card.
